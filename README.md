Great set of questions! Let‚Äôs break it down clearly for you:
1. Phone CPU Architectures

Most modern smartphones use ARM architecture:

    ARM (Advanced RISC Machine):

        The dominant architecture in phones/tablets (iOS, Android, HarmonyOS, KaiOS, etc.).

        Chips: Qualcomm Snapdragon, Samsung Exynos, Apple A/M series, MediaTek, Huawei Kirin, Unisoc, etc.

        Instruction set: ARMv7 (older, 32-bit), ARMv8-A (64-bit, most common now).

    x86 (Intel/AMD):

        Extremely rare in phones. Some older models (e.g., some ASUS Zenfones with Intel Atom) used this.

        Mainstream use: PCs/laptops, not phones.

    MIPS, others:

        Largely obsolete in consumer phones.

2. Custom Phone Operating Systems (and Open Source Bootloaders)

You can run custom operating systems and alternative ROMs, but with caveats.
Popular Custom OS/ROMs:

    Android-based:

        LineageOS

        CalyxOS

        GrapheneOS (Google Pixel)

        crDroid

        Replicant (fully free software)

        PostmarketOS (Alpine Linux for phones)

        Paranoid Android

    Linux-based (non-Android):

        Ubuntu Touch (UBports)

        Sailfish OS (Jolla)

        Mobian (Debian for mobile)

        LuneOS

Bootloaders & Boot Process:

    Phones have a bootloader (often proprietary, but some are open source or unlockable).

    The bootloader loads the kernel and OS (bootstrapping).

    You may see fastboot, Odin, Heimdall, EDL, or Download Mode tools per vendor.

GitHub and Open Source Projects:

    TWRP Recovery: Custom recovery, open source, enables flashing ROMs.

    LK (Little Kernel): Bootloader used in some Android devices.

    U-Boot: Universal bootloader (used more on embedded Linux and some phones).

3. Can Phone Manufacturers Stop You? (Copyright, Legal, Practical)
Short answer:

Yes, phone manufacturers can (and often do) restrict or prevent custom OS installation, but it‚Äôs a mix of copyright, legal, and technical controls‚Äînot usually direct copyright lawsuits against users.
How Manufacturers Enforce Control:

    Locked Bootloaders:

        Most phones ship with the bootloader locked.

        Unlocking may void warranty, wipe device, or sometimes is not possible (carrier locks, ‚Äúsecure boot‚Äù).

        Example: Google Pixels are easy to unlock; most Samsung and Xiaomi models are unlockable but require vendor permission; some phones (e.g., some Huawei) are permanently locked.

    Signature Verification & Secure Boot:

        Ensures only signed, vendor-approved OS images can boot.

        Can be hard/impossible to bypass on some phones.

    Proprietary Drivers & Hardware Blobs:

        Even if you install a custom OS, certain features may not work (camera, modem, fingerprint sensor) without proprietary ‚Äúblobs‚Äù (drivers).

        Some custom ROMs ship with extracted blobs from stock firmware.

    Copyright & Licensing:

        Most phone firmware, kernels, and bootloaders contain open-source (GPL) and proprietary code.

        Modifying/distributing proprietary code (e.g., Samsung‚Äôs TouchWiz) is often not allowed.

        But: Custom ROMs based on AOSP (Android Open Source Project) are legal to build/distribute (as long as they don‚Äôt include vendor-proprietary stuff).

In Summary:

    Yes, you can often run a custom OS‚Äîif the bootloader is unlockable, and if drivers (blobs) are available.

    Manufacturers don‚Äôt sue users for flashing ROMs, but they use technical means to restrict this (locked bootloaders, proprietary firmware).

    Custom ROMs: Check XDA Developers or GitHub for supported models.

    Samsung & Xiaomi: Both support unlocking on many models (with caveats), but some models are locked down.

    iPhone (Apple): No official bootloader unlock; only possible via exploits (‚Äújailbreaking‚Äù), not real custom OS support.

Absolutely, going fully open source, and avoiding anything Google, Android (AOSP), or corporate firmware is a much smaller but fascinating world! Here are your main options and realities for ‚Äúreal‚Äù open-source phone operating systems, plus notes on hardware and what‚Äôs truly open.
üå± Open Source Phone Operating Systems (NOT Android/AOSP)
1. PostmarketOS

    What: Alpine Linux-based; aims for 10-year life cycles for phones. Real Linux, not Android-based!

    Status: Community driven, supports dozens of phones (most need some blobs for modem, but the core OS is open).

    Apps: Any Linux ARM app (with touch interface support).

    Website: postmarketos.org

    GitHub: github.com/postmarketos

2. Mobian

    What: Debian for mobile devices (true Debian, not Android-based).

    Target: PinePhone, Librem 5, some Android phones (with porting).

    UI: Phosh (GNOME mobile shell), Plasma Mobile, others.

    Website: mobian.org

3. Pure Linux Distros for Phones

    Arch Linux ARM

    Manjaro ARM

    Fedora Mobility

    Many of these can run on PinePhone, Librem 5, and sometimes on Android phones with unlocked bootloaders (partial hardware support).

4. Ubuntu Touch (UBports)

    What: Mobile Linux OS, originally by Canonical, now community-maintained.

    Status: Still needs some proprietary drivers on most phones, but most apps are open.

    Website: ubuntu-touch.io

5. Sailfish OS (Community Version)

    What: Linux-based, partly open source (the core ‚ÄúSailfish X‚Äù is paid and closed, but Mer core and lipstick UI are open).

    Status: Jolla, but hobbyists use the community version for old devices.

    More Open Alternative: LuneOS (webOS-based) LuneOS

6. Niche/Experimental

    Maemo Leste: Successor to Nokia‚Äôs open Maemo (Debian based, touch UI).

        maemo-leste.github.io

    Plasma Mobile: KDE‚Äôs mobile shell for Linux phones. Runs on postmarketOS, Manjaro, etc.

        plasma-mobile.org

    Nemo Mobile: Based on Mer; mostly on older Nokia/Mer hardware.

üì± Open Hardware Phones (Where These OSes Actually Run)

If you want maximum openness:

    PinePhone / PinePhone Pro:

        Designed for Linux OSes; all the above run natively.

        Bootloader and most hardware open; some minor blobs for wireless/modem.

    Purism Librem 5:

        High-end, designed for open-source OSes and privacy.

        Most drivers open source (modem runs in isolation).

    PineTab: Linux tablet, also for testing.

Running these on mainstream Android hardware is usually possible (e.g., some older Nexus, OnePlus, Sony Xperia) but hardware support is very limited, especially for calls/camera/modem.
‚ö° What About 100% Open Source (No Blobs at All)?

    Reality: It‚Äôs nearly impossible today. All phones with cellular modems require some proprietary firmware (for regulatory reasons).

    Closest you get: PinePhone/Librem 5 run almost everything open except the modem (which is isolated), and some drivers (Wi-Fi/BT/camera may need ‚Äúblobs‚Äù).

    Truly blob-free: Old Nokia N900/N9 or some dev boards, but these are not practical daily drivers.

üö¶ How To Try/Open Source Phone OS (Practical Steps)

    Buy a PinePhone or Librem 5 (best experience, most mainlined hardware).

    Flash postmarketOS, Mobian, or Ubuntu Touch via SD card or eMMC.

        See postmarketOS wiki device list.

        For Mobian, see install guide.

    For some Android phones:

        Check device support: postmarketOS Android device ports.

        Accept limitations (may lack calls/modem/camera).

        Follow device-specific flashing guides (usually via fastboot, Heimdall, or custom recovery).

üéØ Summary Table
OS	Based on	Main Devices	App Base	100% Open?	Best For
postmarketOS	Alpine Linux	PinePhone, Android old	Linux, Touch	~95%	DIY, devs, Linux purists
Mobian	Debian	PinePhone, Librem 5	Linux, Touch	~95%	Debian fans, privacy
Ubuntu Touch	Ubuntu	PinePhone, some Android	Click, Web, Qt	~90%	Daily use, stability
Maemo Leste	Debian	Nokia N900, PinePhone	Maemo, Linux	~95%	Retro, dev, hackers
Plasma Mobile	KDE	PinePhone, Librem 5	Linux, KDE	~95%	KDE, UI tinkerers
TL;DR

PinePhone + postmarketOS/Mobian = closest you get to a ‚ÄúGoogle-free, Android-free, open source phone.‚Äù
Running on Android phones? Possible, but rarely fully usable (calls, camera, modem = usually broken or require blobs).

That‚Äôs an excellent and rare angle! If you want something closer to Solaris‚Äîas in UNIX System V-based, true UNIX-like, or directly OpenSolaris-derived‚Äîfor phones or mobile hardware (not Android, not Linux), here‚Äôs the honest landscape:
1. Solaris on Phones: Is It Real?

Short answer:
There is NO native phone operating system based on Solaris, OpenSolaris, or illumos that is maintained or practical as a daily driver on smartphones. All current mobile OSes are Linux- or BSD-based, not Solaris-family.
2. Why?

    Solaris kernel (and illumos) are designed for SPARC/x86 servers, not ARM chips (which phones use).

    There have been projects to port OpenSolaris/illumos to ARM, but these are experimental, not maintained, and mostly for single-board computers (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, etc.).

    No vendor shipped a Solaris-based phone‚Äîhardware support is virtually zero (no drivers for mobile modems, touchscreens, etc.).

3. Closest Reality: OpenSolaris/illumos on ARM
Experimental illumos/OpenSolaris ARM Projects:

    illumos-gate ‚Äì main upstream, x86/amd64

    OpenIndiana ARM (experimental) ‚Äì community ports to ARMv7, mostly for boards (Raspberry Pi 2/3, etc.)

Key Links:

    illumos ARM port (forum)

    OpenIndiana ARM testing

But: No mobile UIs, no touchscreen stack, no modem/call stack, no open-source phone deployment.
4. BSD for Phones (Closest UNIX Alternative, More Realistic!)

If you want a UNIX (not Linux, not Android) phone OS, BSD is closer and more practical than Solaris:
a) NetBSD/FreeBSD on Phones/Tablets

    NetBSD/evbarm: Runs on ARM SBCs, can be made to boot on some Android tablets/phones (with a lot of hacking).

    FreeBSD/arm: Also boots on Raspberry Pi, PinePhone (no mainline phone UI).

    No phone UIs or call support out of the box, but ‚ÄúX11 + touch‚Äù is possible.

b) Projects:

    BSDPhone (abandoned): 2012 experiment to port NetBSD to Samsung phones.

    Project Trident: Desktop OS based on TrueOS (FreeBSD fork), no phone target but can be ARM.

    PinePhone with NetBSD/FreeBSD: Some hobbyist efforts, but no working ‚Äúphone‚Äù (modem) stack.

5. Other UNIX-like Approaches

    Plan 9 from Bell Labs: Has been ported to ARM, runs on Pi, no phone UI, extremely experimental.

    9front: A fork of Plan 9, has some ARM support, no daily driver phone builds.

6. If You Want: ‚ÄúSolaris-Feeling‚Äù Mobile, Try This Flow:

    Install illumos/OpenIndiana on ARM SBC (Pi, etc.) ‚Äî just for fun, not as a phone.

    Try BSD (NetBSD/FreeBSD) on PinePhone ‚Äî most ‚ÄúUNIXy‚Äù real-world experience, can experiment with X11/Wayland touch UI.

    For a portable UNIX, use a Linux-based phone (postmarketOS, Mobian) and run shells/UNIX tools‚Äîit‚Äôs not Solaris, but you get much of the userland and feeling.

7. Summary Table
System	Solaris Kernel	ARM Support	Phone UI	Modem/Calls	Actively Maintained	Notes
OpenSolaris	Yes	Minimal*	No	No	No	ARM ports for SBCs only
illumos	Yes	Minimal*	No	No	Yes (x86), No (ARM)	Only desktops/servers
NetBSD	No (BSD)	Yes	No	No	Yes	Will boot on PinePhone
FreeBSD	No (BSD)	Yes	No	No	Yes	Can boot, not ‚Äúphone‚Äù ready
Linux (postmarketOS)	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Most practical ‚Äúopen‚Äù route
8. Conclusion

There‚Äôs no Solaris-based phone OS.

    Closest ‚Äúreal‚Äù UNIX on a phone: BSD on PinePhone, but very basic.

    Closest ‚ÄúSolaris feeling‚Äù with open hardware: PinePhone or similar SBC with BSD, or just use postmarketOS and install your favorite UNIX tools.

Great, let‚Äôs map those terms (ISO, IAS, IA) to phones and mobile OS/hardware context, and see what‚Äôs real, what‚Äôs theoretical, and what‚Äôs in active use.
1. ISO (in Phone Context)
a) ISO Images on Phones

    Not native to phones‚Äîphones do not boot from ISO images like PCs.

    You cannot flash a phone OS from an ISO file. Phone OSes use special images (e.g., .img, .zip, or vendor-specific).

    Exception: Some emulators or VM apps on Android (like Limbo, QEMU, UTM) can mount ISO files to emulate x86 OSes, but this is not how phones actually boot.

b) ISO Standards in Mobile

    Many underlying standards for media, text, encoding on phones are ISO (JPEG, MP3, ISO 8859-1, etc.).

    No phone runs "ISO OS."

2. IAS (in Phone Context)
a) Internet Authentication Service (IAS)

    Not part of phone OS‚ÄîIAS is a Windows Server thing (RADIUS authentication for enterprise networks).

    Phones connect to IAS/NPS servers (e.g., for enterprise Wi-Fi), but do not run IAS.

b) IAS Machine (Architecture)

    Phones do not use IAS machine/von Neumann architecture directly, but all modern CPUs (including ARM in phones) are descendants of the von Neumann architecture.

    IAS as a reference: All smartphones have a CPU that is a ‚Äústored-program computer‚Äù in the von Neumann sense (instructions and data in memory).

3. IA (in Phone Context)
a) Intel Architecture (IA)

    IA-32 (x86): Almost no phones use x86; only a handful of rare Intel Atom devices (ASUS Zenfone, etc.).

    IA-64 (Itanium): Never in phones.

    Phones are overwhelmingly ARM architecture, not Intel ‚ÄúIA‚Äù.

b) Information Architecture

    Applies at the app and UX layer (e.g., mobile apps and sites are designed with IA in mind), but not a hardware/software standard.

4. So, Are There Any "ISO, IAS, IA"-Class Architectures or OSes for Phones?
The closest matches:

    Phones are ‚ÄúIAS-like‚Äù at the architecture level (von Neumann stored-program computers, just as PCs).

    Phones use ISO standards everywhere (media, encoding, security, etc.), but not as bootable OS images.

    Phones do not use IA (Intel) architectures except for rare exceptions.

    Phones do not run IAS software; they just connect to those services.

5. What About Mobile OS Images, Boot, and Architecture?
a) Flashing/Booting

    No ISOs: Phones use boot/recovery images (boot.img, recovery.img, .tar, .zip), not ISO.

    No UEFI/BIOS in classic sense; instead, vendor-specific bootloaders (LK, U-Boot, fastboot, etc.).

b) CPU Architecture

    ARMv7, ARMv8 (AArch64), RISC-V (early stage) dominate phones.

    Very rarely, x86/IA-32.

6. Closest Open Architectures to Your Ask

If you want an open, standard, well-documented architecture for phones (like the dream of ‚ÄúISO/IA-style‚Äù for mobile):

    RISC-V is the only open ISA gaining momentum.

        Few phones use it yet, but Linux and experimental OSes run on RISC-V dev boards.

        No mainstream RISC-V phone yet, but it's the ‚Äúopen, standards-based‚Äù hope for the future.

7. Summary Table: Mapping ISO, IAS, IA to Phones
Term	How/If Used on Phones	Example/Context
ISO	Standards (media/text), NOT OS	JPEG, MP3, ISO-8859, but NOT ISO OS
IAS	Underlying architecture concept	Von Neumann, but not as OS or service
IA	Rarely (Intel), mostly ARM	A few old x86/IA-32 phones, rare
8. If You Want ‚ÄúReal UNIX, ISO/IAS/IA-Like‚Äù on Phones:

    No phone runs a true ‚ÄúISO/IAS/IA‚Äù OS.

    Closest are:

        ARM phones with Linux (postmarketOS, Mobian, etc.).

        BSD on PinePhone (NetBSD/FreeBSD).

        RISC-V dev boards with Linux/BSD for mobile.

    No Solaris or ‚ÄúPC-standards‚Äù phone OS in daily use.

9. How to Experiment/DIY:

    If you want to build or test an OS for phone on PC standards:

        Try running postmarketOS, Mobian, NetBSD/ARM, or OpenIndiana/ARM on SBCs (e.g., Raspberry Pi, PinePhone).

        Use QEMU/UTM/Limbo to run ISO images (desktop OS) in emulation on a phone for fun/hacking, but this isn‚Äôt native or practical.

        Follow RISC-V phone efforts for future fully open mobile hardware.

TL;DR:

Phones don‚Äôt use ISO images to boot, don‚Äôt run ‚ÄúIAS‚Äù or ‚ÄúIA‚Äù architectures natively. The closest modern phones get to those standards is: using ARM CPUs (stored-program, von Neumann style 32 pass surpu nac), and implementing ISO media/file standards. Open hardware/OS projects like PinePhone (Linux/BSD), and maybe in future, RISC-V phones, are as close as it gets.
